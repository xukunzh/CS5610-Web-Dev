## Overview  
This project is a **personal portfolio website** designed to showcase my experience, projects, education, and contact information. The website was built using **HTML** and **CSS**, adhering to fundamental web development principles without any JavaScript or third-party libraries.  

## Features  
- **Responsive Design**: The website is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using **CSS media queries**.  
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes links to all pages, remains fixed during scrolling, and highlights the active page.  
- **Four Unique Pages**:  
  - **Home**: Introduction, education, and experience.  
  - **Projects**: Highlights key projects with links to repositories.  
  - **Contact**: Displays email, GitHub, LinkedIn, and other social media links.  
  - **Interests**: Personal hobbies and interests, with images and descriptions.  
- **Professional Design**: Carefully selected fonts, colors, and spacing for readability and aesthetics.  

## HTML and CSS Components Used  
### HTML Elements:  
- Structural tags: `div`, `span`, `head`, `body`  
- Text tags: `p`, `h1-h6`, `ul`  
- Media tags: `img`, `a`  
- Semantic structure for improved accessibility.  

### CSS Features:  
- Layout: **Flexbox**, **Grid**  
- Styling: `background-color`, `font-family`, `margin`, `padding`, `position`  
- Responsiveness: `@media` queries for adaptive design  
- Interactive Effects: Pseudo-classes (`:hover`), transitions, and transforms  

## Challenges and Learnings  
- **Biggest Challenge**: Creating a responsive design without external libraries required careful use of **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.  
- **Mobile Optimization**: Simplified the navbar for smaller screens and ensured images and text resized dynamically.  
- **Future Improvements**: Plan to add more interactive features like animations and form submission capabilities.  

## Development Details
